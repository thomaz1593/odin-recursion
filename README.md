# Recursion Algorithm

Recursion algorithm of the computer science section from **The Odin Project**.

## Assignment

Small project that leverage recursion to solve two classic problems.
The problems are:

**1. Fibonacci** -> Given a number, create two functions on file `fibonacci.js`: `fibs` and `fibsRec` to return an _array_ with the Fibonacci Sequence, using normal _loops_ and recursion respectively.

**2. Merge sort** -> Function `mergeSort` from file `merge-sort.js` takes in an _array_ and returns a sorted _array_, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

To run this project, use the command: `node file-name.js`.
